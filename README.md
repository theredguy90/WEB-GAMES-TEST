# Proxified Ports!
Basically just a (Hidden and Unblocked) Launcher for my Web Ports

Hidden because the page will initially disgiuse itself as a non-functional page, but by pressing Z, X, C, or ENTER, it will reveal:

The Launcher, which includes UNBLOCKED Links to all of my current ports

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Unblocked Links provided by the Launcher are TEMPORARY, which means they will only work once

Also, the text box allows you to input any page, so it can also work as an unblocker for any page lmao

## Deploying
I'm not gonna be publically hosting this, so here's how you can host it yourself

<br><br>
To deploy this website locally, follow these steps:
<br>
1. Clone the repository: ```https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/Proxified-Ports.git```
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Proxified-Ports`
4. Run `index.html`, ```python3 -m http.server```, or your server of choice.
5. Click [HERE](http://localhost:8000/) to go to the Local Link
